# TuneOptimizer
Automated algorithm using the PyEpics package to communicate with the control system, to optimize tuning through SECAR using a Bayesian Gaussian process optimization.

Analysis from image processing (see [viewer repo](https://github.com/pluflou/Viewer-Image-Analysis)) to locate beam
is used as observations for the optimization.

The algorithms has been tested and shown to work for efficient tuning of the beamline. Currently under further development during the recoil separator's commissioning to improve method and extend to further elements of the device.
