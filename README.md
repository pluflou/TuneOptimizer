# TuneOptimizer
Automated Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes to tune the SECAR beamline. 

An overview of the codes can be found in the manual (PDF). These codes depend on the image analysis output from the viewers along the beamline (see [viewer repo](https://github.com/pluflou/Viewer-Image-Analysis)).

The main packages needed for this and the viewer analysis:

GPy==1.9.9
GPyOpt==1.2.6
matplotlib==2.2.4
numpy==1.16.5
pyepics==3.3.3
scipy==1.2.2
skimage==0.17.2
